# Deep_learning_project
I‚Äôm thrilled to share my latest project, completed as part of my Introduction to Deep Learning course! This experience allowed me to dive deep into the process of building, training, and optimizing machine learning models for image classification tasks. Working with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, I learned so much about transforming theoretical concepts into practical, working solutions.

üîç Project Overview
The project involved creating a machine learning pipeline from scratch, covering all key phases: Dataset Exploration, Model Creation, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Results Documentation. I chose CNN and ResNet architectures to tackle the different challenges posed by MNIST (simple, grayscale images) and CIFAR-10 (more complex, color images), maximizing model performance for each dataset.

üß© Key Components & Insights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Exploration:

MNIST Dataset: With MNIST, I analyzed the distribution of grayscale digits and applied preprocessing techniques to normalize the data, allowing the model to converge faster.

CIFAR-10 Dataset: CIFAR-10 posed greater complexity with its 10 classes of color images, requiring augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation) to enhance the model‚Äôs ability to generalize.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Creation & Architectures:

CNN for MNIST: A CNN was ideal for the simpler MNIST dataset, providing strong accuracy through feature extraction layers that identified digit edges and shapes.

ResNet for CIFAR-10: Given CIFAR-10‚Äôs complexity, I implemented a ResNet architecture to address vanishing gradient issues and improve feature extraction depth. ResNet‚Äôs skip connections allowed the model to handle more detailed color images, leading to higher accuracy.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning: I experimented with various hyperparameters‚Äîbatch sizes, optimizers (SGD, Adam), learning rates, and dropout rates. Each change impacted model performance differently:

MNIST Model: Tweaking learning rates and optimizers helped converge to 99%+ accuracy.

CIFAR-10 Model: I found batch size and dropout rates to be crucial in enhancing generalization on test data, though CIFAR-10 remained challenging.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Results Documentation: Detailed performance metrics, confusion matrices, and graphs helped track model improvement and identify areas for refinement. It was exciting to observe the CNN‚Äôs reliable accuracy on MNIST, while ResNet‚Äôs adaptability on CIFAR-10 confirmed the value of deeper architectures for complex data.

üèÜ Key Takeaways:
Architecture Matters: Choosing the right architecture based on data complexity is crucial. The simplicity of CNNs worked perfectly for MNIST, while ResNet‚Äôs depth was necessary for CIFAR-10.

Hyperparameter Exploration: Even small changes can have substantial effects. Fine-tuning these parameters gave me insight into model behaviors and optimization techniques.

Documentation & Visualization: Recording each step allowed me to understand model strengths and identify potential improvements, while visual tools made results more tangible and easy to analyze.

This experience not only expanded my technical skills with TensorFlow/Keras but also deepened my understanding of model selection, data processing, and tuning techniques in AI applications. Looking forward to exploring more in the world of machine learning!
